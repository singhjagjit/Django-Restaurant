# Django - Restaurant website

> "This is a web application for handling a pizza restaurant’s online orders. Users can browse the restaurant’s menu, add items to their cart, and submit their orders. Meanwhile, the restaurant owners will be able to add and update menu items, and view orders that have been placed."

### Description of the project:

* __Menu__ : This website supports various menu items such as Pizza, Subs, Pasta, Salads, Dinner Platters and so on. User can select size and toppings for the items.

* __Adding Items__: Using Django Admin, site administrators (restaurant owners) can add, update, and remove items on the menu.

* __Registration, Login, Logout__: Site users (customers) can register with username, password, first name, last name, and email address. Customers can then log in and log out of the website.

* __Shopping Cart__: Once logged in, users can see a representation of the restaurant’s menu, where they can add items (along with toppings or extras) to their virtual “shopping cart.” The contents of the shopping can be saved even if a user closes the window, or logs out and logs back in again.

* __Placing an Order__: User can place an order.

* __Viewing Orders__: Site administrators have access to a page where they can view any orders that have already been placed.

* __Mark order as complete__: Site administrators can mark orders as complete and users can see the status of their pending or completed orders.
